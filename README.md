# <h2>Blurry-Loading - Brad Traversy Tutorial </h2>


<legend>
This project created by me. I'm an <em>aspiring software developer</em>. It's an impressive way to apply HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills <b>together</b>. The project takes a loading screen that would normally appear as a single, static image and makes it dynamic, with a <b>blurred animation effect<b>. The blurry loading screen is a great example of how HTML, CSS, and Javascript can be used together to create something visually impressive. Although I did not know how to properly create this project, thanks to Brad's great instructing skills, I can now use this method for future projects.
